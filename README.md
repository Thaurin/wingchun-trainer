## TODO

- [ ] Add a summary when finished with an overview or what was correct and what was incorrect
- [ ] Be able to repeat incorrect answers, or make incorrect answers reappear to reinforce learning
- [ ] Fix layout
- [ ] Implement expert modes: no multiple choice but typing, with and without completion
- [ ] Implement leaderboards
- [ ] Implement text2voice for techniques
- [ ] Integrate motor skills exercise with this app
- [ ] Randoms for left/right for motor skills exercise, instead of just altering left/right
- [ ] Alternating 2-3 for left/right instead of just two
- [x] BUG? Correct anwers becomes (always is?) the last choice, 6
